\section{Introduction}
Modern compilers are often able to automatically vectorize code using 
SIMD instructions.
Take, as an example, the following code snippet: 

\lstinputlisting[caption={\texttt{copy.c}}, label={lst:copy}, language=C]{listings/copy.c}

\noindent We can compile it with the following set of compiler flags
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{-O3}: tells the compiler to use the highest level
        of optimization available.
  \item \texttt{-fno-tree-loop-distribute-patterns}:
        prevents replacing the loop with a call to \texttt{memcpy}
  \item \texttt{-fno-tree-vectorize}: prevents vectorization
\end{itemize}

\noindent Which will produce the following assembly code:

\lstinputlisting[caption={\texttt{copy.c} compiled with vectorizations disabled}, label={lst:copy_compiled}]{listings/copy.s}

\noindent However, by compiling without the \texttt{-fno-tree-vectorize} flag,
the compiler will produce the following vectorized code (note the use of wider instructions and registers):

\lstinputlisting[caption={\texttt{copy.c} compiled with vectorizations enabled}, label={lst:copy_vectorized}]{listings/copy_vectorized.s}

\noindent The main goal of this project is to develop a method for identifying missed opportunities 
for vectorization in existing code. That is, given an existing binary, we want to identify 
loops that could be vectorized but are not.

\section{Related Work}
Autovectorization is \textit{difficult}, compilers tend to miss many optimizations (as shown by \citet{Feng2021})
, and more than often
vectorizing a small piece of code requires large changes to the whole code base 
(as was done for example by \citet{Chen22}).

Compilers have been shown to widely miss out on vectorization opportunities. As an example, \citet{Maleki2021} report that
in their research only 45-71\% of the loops in a benchmark they developed and only a few loops from the real applications 
are vectorized by the compilers they evaluated, which include widely popular compilers such as \texttt{GCC} (version 4.7.0).

Auto-vectorization is still an open field of research: attempts have been made at ``fixing'' the compiler work
by post-processing compiled code (\citet{Porpodas2021}) or by applying Machine Learning to produce improved vectorization schemes
(\citet{Mendis2019}).

\section{Approach}
\subsection{Dataflow Analysis}
Let's look at Listing~\ref{lst:copy_compiled}: there, we can realize that 
the\texttt{load} and \texttt{store} instructions are completely independent (from other instructions of the same type) 
and could, theoretically, be computed in parallel, therefore vectorized. This can be concluded by simply looking at the dataflow,
an example on how a dataflow graph could look like is given on Figure~\ref{fig:dataflow}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics*[width=0.4\linewidth]{img/dataflow.png}
  \caption{Example of dataflow graph for \texttt{copy.c}}
  \label{fig:dataflow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamic Analysis}
In order to build a dataflow graph we will be using the dynamic analysis framework 
\texttt{Intel Pin}\footnote{https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/98830/Pin/doc/html/index.html}.
Intel Pin allows us to instrument single instructions in the assembly to generate 
the appropriate trace information to construct our dataflow graph. 
We opted to use dynamic analysis in our approach as it simplifies the approach of finding missed vectorization when 
compared to an approach using static analysis. For finding vectorization opportunities 
with complex control-flow it is still necessary to use a hybrid approach in order to check for false-positives (or negatives?).
Imagine the case of a masked add/sub operation on vectors. 
If running with the array c = {0} or {1}, we will observe that this is a trivial vectorization, 
when, instead, it is more involved then optimizing it with a vaddps.
XXX mettere codice e inserire questo sotto
Given the trace of execution of a program (instructions and memory accesses), one can build a dataflow graph, on which a dataflow analysis 
can be performed to identify  ``parallel'' computations and thus, vectorization opportunities.

However, we foresee that building the dataflow graph will likely be the greatest challenge this project poses. An alternative,
would this challenge turn out to be too big of a one, could be to simply analyze the program trace directly, to track down for example repeating accesses
to increasing (or decreasing) memory addresses that would be vectorizable but are not.

\subsection{Examples}
To find examples of missed vectorization opportunities we conducted a small research throughout various online resources, namely:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{llvm} forum (\url{https://discourse.llvm.org/})
  \item The \texttt{llvm} issue tracker (\url{https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues})
  \item The \texttt{gcc} bug tracker (\url{https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/})
\end{itemize}
This research aided us into refining the focu sof this project by making us aware of real and existing challenges that widely
used compiler face when vectorizing code. On top of that, it also helped us better understand which patterns are more prone to go 
``unvectorized''. We hereby report two indicative examples of the collection of unvectorized pieces of code we compiled.

\subsubsection{Example 2}
https://godbolt.org/z/Mh8Y9d41G
\subsection{Test Inputs}
To test our results, we will use an already existing autovectorization benchmark: \texttt{TSVC}\footnote{https://github.com/UoB-HPC/TSVC\_2}.
Other random program generators such \texttt{YARPGen}\footnote{https://github.com/intel/yarpgen} could be used to generate more, less specific, test inputs.

\section{Implementation and Experimential Settings}
To ease our work, and build a first prototype of our project, we focused on a specific version of a specific compiler, namely \texttt{gcc 11.4}.
